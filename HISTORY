mimprint v0.2.1  June 20, 2008  The Scala-based main window is now the default

  Enhancements:

  * The new main screens now support displaying in two windows at once.
    In particular, when using Alternate Screen mode or Dual Window mode,
    the main display window is still functional.
  * When images are added to the printable list (either by drag-and-drop
    or by using the 'p' key command or Add To Active PlayList menu command),
    the image is automatically rotated by 90 degrees counter-clockwise
    if necessary to match the aspect ratio of the image most closely to
    the aspect ratio of its display area.  Pressing the 'r' key will
    rotate the image by 180 degrees.  If you really want to rotate the
    image by 90 degrees, you should select that area and adjust the
    margins to force a change in the aspect ratio of the area.

  Other Changes:

  * The "-old" command line option brings up the old Java-based main
    window; without that option, the new Scala-based main window opens.
    The Java-based main window will not be available in the next version.
  * The new Scala-based main window does not offer all of the View options
    that were available in the old Java-based main window.

mimprint v0.2.0  June 4, 2008  Scala/Java mix

  Enhancements:

  * Mimprint now supports playlists.
    See below for the format of a playlist file.
    + If you create a file called index.mpr in a directory that contains
      images, that playlist file will be opened when you ask to open that
      directory.
    + You can open any playlist file by using the File/Open menu command.
      This allows you to have more than only playlist in a directory,
      or to have playlists that include files from multiple directories.
    + The "p" keybaord shortcut copies the current item to the active
      playlist.  The active playlist can be selected by using the Active
      command in the new PlayList menu.
  * The "N of M" messages now keep separate counts for folders versus files.
  * The new Dual Window Mode opens a second window on the same screen.
    This can then be moved onto another screen if desired, for cases where
    the Alternate Screen Mode is not working.
  * The Alternate Screen Mode menu command is now available only when
    there is an alternate screen.
  * The new "Include Folder Dates In List" option in the View mwnu,
    which is off by default, allows to show or hide the folder date,
    which can be confusing since it is the date of the last edit of any
    file in that folder.
  * The distribution now includes a startup script called "mim" for
    Linux and Mac systems.

  Bug Fixes:

  * The correct screen mode is now shown as selected on startup.
  * Changes to the choice of what is displayed in the List from the View menu
    now take effect immediately.
  * The "N of M" messages are now properly sorted.
  * Pushing ESC from Full Screen mode now returns to whatever mode was
    previously selected.  ESC will also toggle from any mode to the
    previously selected mode, as long as that was not Full Screen Mode.
  * When moving to the previous directory and displaying the last item
    in the list, the list now scrolls to the end so that item is visible.

  Playlist file format:

  + The file is line oriented, each line is processed alone.
  + Lines starting with a pound sign (#) are treated as comments.
  + Consecutive lines starting with a double-pound sign (##) at the
    beginning of a file are treated as comments associated with the file.
    Other comment lines are associated with the following filename.
    Comments after the last filename are ignore and will most likely
    be dropped when the playlist is saved back to a file.
  + Blank lines are treated as comments.
  + Leading and trailing whitespace on a line are ignored.
  + Image filename lines consist of a filename, optionally followed
    by option values separated by a semicolon.
  + The option "-r" says to rotate the image clockwise 90 degrees.
  + The option "+r" says to rotate the image counter-clockwise 90 degrees.
  + The option "++r" says to rotate the image by 180 degrees.
  + An item entry may contain the special line "-empty" instead of a filename.
    This represents an empty item in the playlist.
  + Example image filename line:
        foo.jpg;+r

mimprint v0.1.2  January 11, 2007

  Bug Fixes:

  * Focus is now set in the text box when the edit image info dialog
    opens, so it is no longer necessary to click there before typing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

mimprint v0.1.1  August 24, 2006

  Enhancements:

  * The View menu now includes a "Show Info In List" option that shows
    the image info but not an icon.  The "Show Image In List" menu item
    has been renamed to "Show Image and Info In List" for clarity.

  Bug Fixes:

  * When entering a directory, the first non-directory file is now selected
    by default.  This makes navigating into the next directory work properly.
  * After updating the text associated with an image, the display is now
    immediately updated, and the new text appears properly in the Info and
    Edit popup dialogs.
