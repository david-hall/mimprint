mimprint v0.2.0

  Enhancements:

  * The "N of M" messages now keep separate counts for folders versus files.
  * The new Dual Window Mode opens a second window on the same screen.
    This can then be moved onto another screen if desired, for cases where
    the Alternate Screen Mode is not working.
  * The Alternate Screen Mode menu command is now available only when
    there is an alternate screen.

  Bug Fixes:

  * The "N of M" messages are now properly sorted.
  * Pushing ESC from Full Screen mode now returns to whatever mode was
    previously selected.  ESC will also toggle from any mode to the
    previously selected mode, as long as that was not Full Screen Mode.

mimprint v0.1.2  January 11, 2007

  Bug Fixes:

  * Focus is now set in the text box when the edit image info dialog
    opens, so it is no longer necessary to click there before typing.

mimprint v0.1.1  March 1, 2006

  Enhancements:

  * The View menu now includes a "Show Info In List" option that shows
    the image info but not an icon.  The "Show Image In List" menu item
    has been renamed to "Show Image and Info In List" for clarity.

  Bug Fixes:

  * When entering a directory, the first non-directory file is now selected
    by default.  This makes navigating into the next directory work properly.
  * After updating the text associated with an image, the display is now
    immediately updated, and the new text appears properly in the Info and
    Edit popup dialogs.
