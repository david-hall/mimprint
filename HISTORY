mimprint v0.2.4

  Enhancements:

  * The Save/SaveAs/Discard/Cancel dialog displayed when moving to another
    directory and there have been changes to the current playlist now
    has key accelerators (S/A/D/C), and Save is the default (so can be
    activated by pressing Enter).
  * When moving quickly through a list, the program attempts to skip some
    screen updates of images when it gets behind.  The next and previous
    images are now pre-cached to improve performance when stepping slowly
    through a list.
  * The 'd' command can be used to drop an image (delete the reference)
    from a playlist.  The image file itself is not deleted.

  Bug Fixes:

  * Pictures which have been rotated clockwise now scale properly.
  * Fixed the label on the "Save As" menu command in the List menu
    (it mistakenly said just "Save", so there were to "Save" commands).
  * After updating the folder summary text, the list display now updates
    to show the edited text.
  * When a playlist has been modified, attempting to exit now asks for
    confirmation and allows the playlist to be saved first.
  * Updates only to text files (which are not in the playlist) no longer
    cause the playlist to be marked as modified (which causes the program
    to ask the user if it should be saved when that is not necessary).
  * A MatchError when dragging has been fixed.  Also, the drop cursor works
    a bit better when dragging from one image area to another, although it
    still does not quite work properly when dragging from a list to an area.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

mimprint v0.2.3  July 14, 2008  Minor bug fixes and enhancements

  Enhancements:

  * The current directory is now displayed as separate path components,
    as in Mac browsers, so you can directly select any parent
    directory in the path.
  * There is now a menu command in the popup menu, also using the E key,
    to edit the summary.txt file for the current folder.
  * The List menu now includes a Save As command which prompts for a filename
    to which to save the list.  The Save command now saves to the default
    location, the file from which the list was loaded.
  * There is now a right-click popup menu on the List display for image
    entries (but not for directory entries) containing a menu command
    to remove that item from the PlayList.
  * When the list of printable images is larger than will fit on one
    page, printing of those images will now print on multiple pages,
    using the same layout on each page.  A Page selection box appears
    on the Printable page allowing you to select which page of images
    appears on the screen.
  * There is now a mim.bat startup script for Windows.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

mimprint v0.2.2  June 29, 2008  Conversion to Scala complete

  Enhancements:

  * The Dual Window and Alternate Screen modes are now independently
    selectable options (Show Second Window and Show On Alternate Screen).
  * The new Print List on the right hand side of the main window lists
    the files that are in the printable list, and which are displayed
    in Printable Mode.  You can control whether this is visible with
    the new Show Print List menu item in the View menu.
  * At the top of the image lists (both the Main List and the Print List)
    there is now a small title bar with an Options menu that allows
    you to set options for that list.  One of the options allows you
    to show a small image viewer at the bottom of the list.  This is
    useful when operating in Printable mode.
  * The image view windows now include a context menu that opens on a
    right mouse click.
  * The context menu in images in Printable Mode allows you to insert
    blank images and delete images from the Print List, which in turn
    affects the location of the images in the print layout.

  Other Changes:

  * Mimprint has been converted completely over to Scala.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

mimprint v0.2.1  June 20, 2008  The Scala-based main window is now the default

  Enhancements:

  * The new main screens now support displaying in two windows at once.
    In particular, when using Alternate Screen mode or Dual Window mode,
    the main display window is still functional.
  * When images are added to the printable list (either by drag-and-drop
    or by using the 'p' key command or Add To Active PlayList menu command),
    the image is automatically rotated by 90 degrees counter-clockwise
    if necessary to match the aspect ratio of the image most closely to
    the aspect ratio of its display area.  Pressing the 'r' key will
    rotate the image by 180 degrees.  If you really want to rotate the
    image by 90 degrees, you should select that area and adjust the
    margins to force a change in the aspect ratio of the area.

  Other Changes:

  * The "-old" command line option brings up the old Java-based main
    window; without that option, the new Scala-based main window opens.
    The Java-based main window will not be available in the next version.
  * The new Scala-based main window does not offer all of the View options
    that were available in the old Java-based main window.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

mimprint v0.2.0  June 4, 2008  Scala/Java mix

  Enhancements:

  * Mimprint now supports playlists.
    See below for the format of a playlist file.
    + If you create a file called index.mpr in a directory that contains
      images, that playlist file will be opened when you ask to open that
      directory.
    + You can open any playlist file by using the File/Open menu command.
      This allows you to have more than only playlist in a directory,
      or to have playlists that include files from multiple directories.
    + The "p" keybaord shortcut copies the current item to the active
      playlist.  The active playlist can be selected by using the Active
      command in the new PlayList menu.
  * The "N of M" messages now keep separate counts for folders versus files.
  * The new Dual Window Mode opens a second window on the same screen.
    This can then be moved onto another screen if desired, for cases where
    the Alternate Screen Mode is not working.
  * The Alternate Screen Mode menu command is now available only when
    there is an alternate screen.
  * The new "Include Folder Dates In List" option in the View mwnu,
    which is off by default, allows to show or hide the folder date,
    which can be confusing since it is the date of the last edit of any
    file in that folder.
  * The distribution now includes a startup script called "mim" for
    Linux and Mac systems.

  Bug Fixes:

  * The correct screen mode is now shown as selected on startup.
  * Changes to the choice of what is displayed in the List from the View menu
    now take effect immediately.
  * The "N of M" messages are now properly sorted.
  * Pushing ESC from Full Screen mode now returns to whatever mode was
    previously selected.  ESC will also toggle from any mode to the
    previously selected mode, as long as that was not Full Screen Mode.
  * When moving to the previous directory and displaying the last item
    in the list, the list now scrolls to the end so that item is visible.

  Playlist file format:

  + The file is line oriented, each line is processed alone.
  + Lines starting with a pound sign (#) are treated as comments.
  + Consecutive lines starting with a double-pound sign (##) at the
    beginning of a file are treated as comments associated with the file.
    Other comment lines are associated with the following filename.
    Comments after the last filename are ignore and will most likely
    be dropped when the playlist is saved back to a file.
  + Blank lines are treated as comments.
  + Leading and trailing whitespace on a line are ignored.
  + Image filename lines consist of a filename, optionally followed
    by option values separated by a semicolon.
  + The option "-r" says to rotate the image clockwise 90 degrees.
  + The option "+r" says to rotate the image counter-clockwise 90 degrees.
  + The option "++r" says to rotate the image by 180 degrees.
  + An item entry may contain the special line "-empty" instead of a filename.
    This represents an empty item in the playlist.
  + Example image filename line:
        foo.jpg;+r

mimprint v0.1.2  January 11, 2007

  Bug Fixes:

  * Focus is now set in the text box when the edit image info dialog
    opens, so it is no longer necessary to click there before typing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

mimprint v0.1.1  August 24, 2006

  Enhancements:

  * The View menu now includes a "Show Info In List" option that shows
    the image info but not an icon.  The "Show Image In List" menu item
    has been renamed to "Show Image and Info In List" for clarity.

  Bug Fixes:

  * When entering a directory, the first non-directory file is now selected
    by default.  This makes navigating into the next directory work properly.
  * After updating the text associated with an image, the display is now
    immediately updated, and the new text appears properly in the Info and
    Edit popup dialogs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

mimprint v0.1.0  March 1, 2006

    + Display multiple images in one window.
    + Drag-and-drop in printable window to copy images between areas.
    + Can drag images from file list to printable window.
    + DEL/BS in printable window clears image from an area.
    + Add Print command to File menu to print contents of printable window.
    + Control bar above Printable window allows editing the layout of
      the images within the window.

    + List On Left command to put list of image files down the side.
    + Show Image In List command puts image icons in the list.
  * Add 'a' command to display on an alternate screen.
  * Add 's' command to display slideshow mode (formerly "normal", the default).
  * Use separate window for full-screen mode, make it work better.
  * Remove dependence on JAI, so this version now runs on MacOSX.

  Bug Fixes:

  * Keep focus in image window so key commands always work.
  * Fix some NPEs when problems finding image files.
  * The split pane can now be used to make the image smaller.

  Other Changes:

  * Add build.xml and build.properties to allow building with ant.
  * Renamed from jiviewer to mimprint.
