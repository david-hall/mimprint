jiviewer (Jimmc's Image Viewer) is an image viewing and printing program
to make it easy to view JPG and GIF files of any pixel size and to lay out
a set of photos for printing at any size.

For more information, see README.html.

In full-screen mode, a single image is scaled to fill the screen, with
nothing else visible; arrow keys are used to step between images.  In normal
mode, there is a border of controls around the image.
