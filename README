jiviewer is an image viewing program (Jimmc's Image Viewer), to make
it easy to view JPG and GIF files of any pixel size.  In full-screen
mode, a single image is scaled to fill the screen, with nothing else
visible; arrow keys are used to step between images.  In normal mode,
there is a border of controls around the image.
