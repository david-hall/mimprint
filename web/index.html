    <li>June 4, 2008: v0.2.0 released.
        This version of mimprint is a bit messy because I have just
	started converting it over to Scala.
	I am posting it as an example
	that demonstrates one way to build a program that combines
	Scala and Java.
	The problem with trying to compile both Java and Scala
	in an application
	is that the current version of the Scala compiler
	does not handle Java files, so the Java and Scala files must be
	separately compiled.  This makes it difficult for both kinds of
	files to refer to code in the other kind of file.
	I chose to solve this problem by eliminating references from
	Java code to Scala, and only using references from Scala to Java.
	This is done the following way:
	<ol>
	<li>For any place where I want to call Scala code from Java code,
	    I create a Java interface and use that when calling from Java,
	    then write a Scala class that implements that interface.
	<li>To allow instantiating those Scala classes, I have a Factory
	    interface, written in Java, and an instance of that Factory
	    written in Scala.  Once the Java classes have a handle on that
	    Factory instance, they can call its methods to create the Scala
	    objects, which are returned with types that are Java interfaces.
	<li>My main class is written in Scala.  It creates the instance of
	    the Factory interface, then passes that instance to a Java class
	    which can provide it to other Java classes that need it
	</ol>
    <li>August 24, 2006: v0.1.1 released.
        A few small bug fixes.
    <li>February 24, 2006: v0.1.0 released.
        This is the first release of Mimprint.
