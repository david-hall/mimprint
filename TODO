- Make preload of adjacent pictures preload a full-size scaled version if
  we are running in full-screen mode. (020817)
- If an image is rotated, remember that in the ImageBundle so that if we
  back up to it right away, we still see the rotated image. (020817)
- Fix how rotating is done to remove intermediate step of creating and
  waiting for a rotated image. (020818)
- Add pan/zoom commands. (020818)
- Allow specifying multiple image files and use that as the list of files
  rather than using a directory list (if >1 file specified). (020818)
- Look for a special file in each directory (e.g. images.jiv) with one line
  per image to display, each line having a file name and possibly flags such
  as whether to rotate it. (020818)
- Add a command to tell jiviewer to record the current rotation state to
  the images.jiv files; add a command to tell it to remove this filename from
  the images.jiv file; add a command to tell it to create an images.jiv file
  from the current viewing information. (020828)
- When starting at a directory, if no images in that directory, look in
  subdirectories, start there if found. (020818)
- In dialog advancing to next directory, give the name of this directory
  and the next one. (020818)
- Add a flag to tell it whether to use big fonts or not; perhaps a "-tv"
  option to make it use big fonts; use normal fonts if no "tv" option. (020828)
