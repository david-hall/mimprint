Bugs:

PlayLists:
- Allow specifying multiple image files and use that as the list of files
  rather than using a directory list (if >1 file specified). (020818)
- Look for a special file in each directory (e.g. images.mmp) with one line
  per image to display, each line having a file name and possibly flags such
  as whether to rotate it. (020818)
- Call the above a "Playlist" file.  Allow specifying a playlist file on
  the command line, in which case it displays all images listed in that
  playlist file.  Allow multiple playlist files on the command line; 
  allow mixing playlist files and image files; all playlist files to
  contain the names of other playlist files as well as image files. (021101)
- Add a command to tell mimprint to record the current rotation state to
  the images.mmp files; add a command to tell it to remove this filename from
  the images.mmp file; add a command to tell it to create an images.mmp file
  from the current viewing information. (020828)

Pan/Zoom:
* Add pan/zoom commands. (020818)
- Use +, - and = to zoom in, out, and zoom to 1.0 scale.  When zoomed in,
  use scroll bars on viewing area. (021101)
- Use _ to zoom to fit-to-window (or perhaps _ to use 1.0 scale, = to fit
  window?). (021211)

Printable:
* Add a "mark for print" command that adds this image to an in-memory list
  of images to be printed.  Put an indicator in the image filename list
  so user can see it is marked for printing. 
  Make the printable image mode handle multiple
  pages.  Add a command to take the marked images and drop them into the
  slots on the multiple pages, advancing to the next page when each page
  is full. (071230)
- Add a command to clear an image area. (060123)

Misc:
- Add ability to search through summary.txt and image.txt files. (080425)
* Add auto-slideshow mode, so that it automatically advances to the next
  slide after N seconds (settable in a perference dialog). (071230)
- Add slideshow mode, random order, loop within directory vs auto-advance,
  slideshow on playlist. (021211)
- Create a .mim directory within each viewed directory: put thumbnails there,
  put a file there with rotation info.  Could also put the mark-for-print
  info there, so that you can spend a long time marking and come back later
  to print. (071230)
- In dialog advancing to next directory, give the name of this directory
  and the next one. (020818)
