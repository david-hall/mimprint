<a name="introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>
<p>
Mimprint is an image printing and viewing program
written in Scala (100% Java-compatible)  and distributed under the GPL.
In addition to providing a way to view and step through GIF and JPEG images,
it allows laying out multiple images at different sizes on one page
for printing.

<p>
<a name="homepage"><h2>Home Page</h2></a>
<p>
Go to the
<a href="http://www.alumni.caltech.edu/~jimmc/mimprint">
Mimprint home page</a>
to download the latest version of Mimprint.

<p>
<a name="features"><h2>Features</h2></a>
<ul>
  <li>Licensed under GPL, freely redistributable with source.
  <li>Written in Scala, runs on any standar Java Virtual machine,
      runs on Windows, Mac and Unix.
  <li>Three viewing modes:
  <ul>
    <li>Printable mode allows collecting images onto a page for printing.
    <li>SlideShow viewing mode allows easily stepping through a folder of
        image files.
    <li>Full screen mode scales images to fit in a full-window frame.
  </ul>
  <li>Images can be displayed on an alternate screen, such as for viewing
      on an external display.
  <li>Images can be displayed in a second window, which can be moved and
      resized to fit an alternate screen when mimprint is
      used in an environment in which the alternate screen is not detected
      (such as can happen when using X remotely).
  <li>View and edit image playlists.
  <li>Browser with optional image icons
      allows easy navigation of image directories.
  <li>Browser allows easy navigation through collections of layout templates.
  <li>Images can be dragged and dropped to any area in the printable page
      from the browser, any other printable page area, or external programs.
  <li>Images and directories can be annotated using text files.
  <li>Prints a single image on a page, or multiple copies of a single image,
      or multiple images, all at the same size or at different sizes
      by using layout templates.
  <li>Layout templates included for common layouts.
  <li>Easy creation of custom layouts.
  <li>Load/save custom layout templates.
</ul>

<p>
<a name="documentation"><h2>Documentation</h2></a>
<p>
Sorry, but there is no Users Guide yet.
<p>
Try this:
<ul>
<li>From the View menu, select Printable Screen Mode.
<li>In the Main List browser, from the Main List menu, enable
    the option to show image icons in the list.
<li>In the browser on the left side of the screen, browse to the
    templates/mixedsize folder.
    You should see small images of the templates in the browser.
<li>Click on a template.
    That layout should appear in the main window.
<li>Drag some images from the browser or your system's regular file
    browser and drop them in the boxes.
<li>Explore the menus.
</ul>
<p>
For programmers, the scaladoc-generated
<a href="doc/api/index.html">API Reference</a>
provides detailed documentation on the packages and classes used in
Mimprint (available after you have <a href="#source">unpacked the source</a>).

<a name="knownproblems"><h2>Known Problems</h2></a>
<p>
<ul>
<li>On Windows, drag-and-drop from the file list into the printable image
    window does not work.
    Dragging from Windows Explorer into the image window works.
<li>On some versions of Linux, printing fails saying the printer is not
    accepting jobs.
    This is a problem with the way the Java VM interfaces to the system
    print queues.
    In general, Java Printing is problematic, and may not work on some
    versions of Java on some platforms.
    Sorry - try another version of Java.
</ul>
<p>
If you happen to know a solution to the above two problems,
please let me know.
Meanwhile, I am hoping that a future version of Java will fix
these problems.

<a name="installjava"><h2>Installing Java</h2></a>
<p>
To install Java on your system,
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp">download JRE1.5</a> -
or, if usable on your platform
(see the <a href="#javarequirements">Requirements</a> section above),
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/download.html">download JRE1.4</a> -
from 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/">Sun's Java web site</a>
and follow those installation directions.

When you are at that download page, look for the section that says
<a href="http://javashoplm.sun.com/ECom/docs/Welcome.jsp?StoreId=22&PartDetailId=jre-1.5.0_06-oth-JPR&SiteId=JSC&TransactionId=noreg">
Download JRE 5.0</a> (for Java 1.5) -
or, for Java 1.4.2,
<b>Download J2SE JRE</b> -
find your platform, and download the jre installer file.

<p>
<a name="installmimprint"><h2>Installing Mimprint</h2></a>
<p>
Mimprint is delivered in a self-extracting JAR file.
You must have Java running on your system in order to extract it.

<p>
To install Mimprint from the installation JAR file (.jar extension),
double-click on the JAR file, or run the command
<blockquote>
<code>
java -jar mimprint-<i>N_N_N</i>.jar
</code>
</blockquote>
where <i>N_N_N</i> is replaced by the Mimprint version number.
This will open a dialog allowing you to specify a destination directory,
and it will create a directory called mimprint-<i>N_N_N</i>
in the specified directory,

<p>
If you have problems running the installer, you can try running it with
the debugging flag turned on, which will cause it to print more information:
<blockquote>
<code>
java -Dmimprint.install.debug -jar mimprint-<i>N_N_N</i>.jar
</code>
</blockquote>

<p>
If you double-click on the installer in Windows and nothing happens,
open a DOS command window,
cd to the folder into which you downloaded the installer,
and enter the java command shown above.
Any error messages should now show up in the DOS window.

<p>
<a name="source"><h2>Unpacking the Mimprint Source</h2></a>

<p>
If you want to build Mimprint yourself, or just look at the source code,
you will have to unpack the source files from the <code>src.zip</code>
archive file with the commands
<blockquote>
<code>cd mimprint-<i>N_N_N</i><br>
      unzip src.zip</code>
</blockquote>
This will create a <code>src</code> directory with all of the Scala files,
as well as adding a few other files (such as a build.xml file)
to your mimprint directory.
You must have the
<a href="http://ant.apache.org/">ant</a> program installed on your
system in order to build Mimprint from source files.

<p>
You will also need a scala development environment.
You can download this from the
<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala web page</a>.

<p>
If you want to look at the scaladoc-generated API documentation
for the Java classes, you must first unpack those html files from
the <code>apidoc.zip</code> archive file with the commands
<blockquote>
<code>cd mimprint-<i>N_N_N</i><br>
      unzip apidoc.zip</code>
</blockquote>
This will create the directory doc/api with all of the API documentation in it.
Alternatively, you can unpack <code>src.zip</code> and then run the command
<blockquote>
<code>ant doc</code>
</blockquote>
to run scaladoc and create the API documents from the source files
(you must have the
<a href="http://ant.apache.org/">ant</a> program installed on your
system in order to create the documentation using this command).

<p>
The Mimprint kit does not include the source to the JShortcut package.
You can download the JShortcut source from the
<a href="http://www.alumni.caltech.edu/~jimmc/jshortcut/">
JShortcut web site</a>,
or from the same location from which you downloaded Mimprint.
You do not need the JShortcut source to compile Mimprint;
the JShortcut.jar file included in the Mimprint kit is sufficient.

<p>
<a name="running"><h2>Running Mimprint</h2></a>
<p>
If you have not already done so, you must
<a href="#installjava">install Java</a>.

<h4>On Windows</h4>
<p>
On Windows,
double-click on the shortcut (if you have set one up)
or CD to the directory containing mimprint.jar
and run
<blockquote>
<code>java -jar mimprint.jar</code>
</blockquote>
You can manually set up a shortcut to mimprint.jar.

<h4>On Unix</h4>
On Unix, run
<blockquote>
<code>java -jar mimprint.jar</code>
</blockquote>
If the java binary is not in your PATH, you can explicitly specify the
Scala to it.  For example, if you have installed JDK1.5 into
<code>/usr/local/jdk1.5</code>,
you can run mimprint with the command
<blockquote>
<code>/usr/local/jdk1.5/bin/java -jar mimprint.jar</code>
</blockquote>
<p>
On Solaris 2.6 or later, you can directly run mimprint.jar.

<h4>Starting at a specified location</h4>
<p>
On any platform you can include an image file or directory name
when starting mimprint to tell it to start in that directory.
Just include that name as the first argument after the above command,
like this:
<blockquote>
<code>java -jar mimprint.jar /home/jimmc/photos/folder1</code>
</blockquote>
